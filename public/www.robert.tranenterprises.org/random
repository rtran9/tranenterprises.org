            <blockquote>"We need not to be let alone. We need to be really bothered once in a while. How long is it since you were really bothered? About something important, about something real?"
                <br> -Ray Bradbury, Fahrenheit 451</blockquote>
            <blockquote>"I pick, I pick for both of us." <br> -Room</blockquote>
